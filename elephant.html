                <p>>>Elephants are the largest land animals, known for their long tusks, large ears, and trunks. They are highly intelligent and social creatures, living in matriarchal herds led by the oldest female. Elephants play a vital role in maintaining the balance of their ecosystems.<br>
                    >>The elephant is the largest land animal on Earth. It is known for its long trunk, tusks, and large ears. Elephants are herbivores, feeding mainly on leaves, grasses, bamboo, and fruits. They are highly intelligent and social animals, living in groups called herds. Elephants have a strong sense of family and are known for their deep emotional bonds. Unfortunately, elephants are threatened by habitat loss, poaching for their tusks, and human-wildlife conflict. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect these majestic creatures for future generations.</p>
