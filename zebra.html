                <p>>>Zebras are striped herbivores closely related to horses and donkeys. Their distinctive black and white striped coat serves as camouflage and a natural defense mechanism against predators. Zebras are social animals that live in groups called herds.<br>
                   >>Zebras are known for their distinctive black and white striped coats, which make them easily recognizable in the wild. These striped patterns are unique to each individual zebra, similar to human fingerprints. Zebras are herbivores, feeding on grasses, leaves, and stems. They are social animals and often found in groups called dazzles.<br>
                   >>Zebras have excellent eyesight and hearing, which help them detect predators such as lions and hyenas. They are fast runners and can reach speeds of up to 65 km/h to escape from danger. Zebras also have a strong sense of community within their groups and display behaviors like mutual grooming to strengthen social bonds.<br>
                    
                    >>Conservation efforts are important to protect zebras as they face threats such as habitat loss, poaching for their skin and meat, and competition with livestock for grazing areas. Preserving their natural habitats and promoting sustainable wildlife management practices are essential for the long-term survival of these iconic animals.</p>
