                    >>Giraffes are fascinating creatures known for their long necks, legs, and unique spotted coat patterns. They are the tallest land animals in the world, with their long necks helping them reach leaves high up in trees for food. Giraffes have long tongues, which can be up to 18 inches in length, aiding them in grasping and pulling leaves from branches. These gentle giants are herbivores, primarily feeding on leaves and buds from trees and shrubs.<br>

                    >>Giraffes are social animals and often found in groups called towers. They have excellent eyesight and a strong sense of hearing, helping them detect predators in the wild. Conservation efforts are crucial for protecting giraffes as they face threats such as habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict. Preserving their natural habitats and raising awareness about their conservation status are essential to ensure the survival of these iconic animals.</p>
